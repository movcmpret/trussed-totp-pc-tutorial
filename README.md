# trussed-totp-pc-tutorial

This is a simple application implementing OATH TOTP, built on [Trussed][trussed]<sup>Â®</sup>.

To try it out, run `make install`, and then for instance
```
trussed-totp-pc-tutorial register alice@trussed.dev JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXPJBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP
```
This registers a credential, which is stored in `state.littlefs2`.

To generate a one-time password, run
```
trussed-totp-pc-tutorial authenticate alice@trussed.dev
```

For more logging prefix commands with, e.g., `RUST_LOG=debug`.
